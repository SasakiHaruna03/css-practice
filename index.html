                Plants form the foundation of most terrestrial ecosystems, producing
                oxygen and serving as primary food sources. This page summarizes
                some of the most fascinating and diverse plant groups, from
                common flowers to unique specialized forms.

        <p>
            The Rosaceae family includes beloved flowers like roses, as well as essential
            food crops such as apples, pears, peaches, and strawberries. This family is
            characterized by flowers typically having five petals and numerous stamens.
            Roses themselves are known for their ornamental value, wide variety of colors,
            and often intense fragrance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Roses have significant cultural and symbolic value worldwide, representing
            love, beauty, and war across various traditions. Ecologically, they provide
            nectar and pollen to various insects, and their hips (fruits) are a food
            source for birds and wildlife.

    <h2>🌷 Orchids (Orchidaceae)</h2>

    </figure>

    <p>
        Orchids constitute one of the largest families of flowering plants, boasting highly specialized and often complex flower structures. These unique forms have evolved to facilitate specific pollination methods, frequently involving a single type of insect or bird. Orchids are found on every continent except Antarctica and thrive in diverse habitats, from high-altitude mountains to tropical rainforests.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many tropical orchids are epiphytes, meaning they grow harmlessly on other plants (like trees) for physical support, rather than drawing nutrients from them. Their tiny seeds rely on specific symbiotic fungi to germinate. Their remarkable adaptations and delicate beauty make them a highly prized group in horticulture.

    <h2>🌻 Composites (Asteraceae)</h2>

    </figure>

    <p>
        The Asteraceae (Daisy or Composite family) is the largest family of vascular plants, including familiar species like sunflowers, daisies, dandelions, and lettuce. The defining characteristic is the **capitulum** (flower head), which looks like a single flower but is actually a dense cluster of many tiny individual flowers, called florets. These can be ray florets (petal-like) and disc florets (tube-like).
    </p>

    <p>
        This family's success is due to its efficient structure for attracting pollinators and maximizing seed production. Many species are economically significant, used as food (sunflower oil, artichokes), medicinal herbs, and popular ornamental flowers. They are found globally and are highly adaptable to various ecological niches.

    <h2>💧 Carnivorous Plants</h2>

        <figcaption>食虫植物は、窒素の乏しい土壌で生きるために昆虫を捕らえます。</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Carnivorous plants are fascinating flora that derive some or most of their nutrient requirements from trapping and consuming animals, typically insects and other arthropods. This unusual behavior is an adaptation to help them thrive in environments where the soil is poor in essential nutrients, particularly nitrogen.
    </p>

    <p>
        They employ various trapping mechanisms, including pitfall traps (pitcher plants), sticky flypaper traps (sundews), snap traps (Venus flytraps), and bladder traps (bladderworts). After trapping prey, the plants use digestive enzymes to break down the soft parts of the insect, absorbing the released nutrients.

    <h2>🌿 Mosses (Bryophytes)</h2>
    <figure>

        <figcaption>コケ植物は、根を持たず、胞子で繁殖する、原始的な非維管束植物です。</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Mosses are small, non-vascular plants belonging to the division Bryophyta. Unlike most plants, they lack true roots, stems, and leaves that contain lignin and vascular tissue. Instead, they absorb water and nutrients directly through their surfaces. They reproduce via spores, not seeds, and thrive in damp, shaded locations, forming dense, spongy mats.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mosses play a crucial ecological role in pioneering new habitats, preventing soil erosion, and retaining moisture in forest floors. They are essential indicators of environmental health and contribute significantly to carbon storage. Being non-vascular means they are limited in size and typically remain close to the ground.

    <h2>🌵 Succulents (Cacti, etc.)</h2>

        <img src="succulent.jpg" alt="水分を蓄えた厚い葉を持つ、さまざまな種類の多肉植物の群生" width="250" height="180">
        <figcaption>多肉植物は、乾燥地帯で生き残るために葉や茎に水分を貯蔵する植物です。</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Succulents are a broad group of plants, spanning many different families (including Cacti, Aloes, and Agaves), that share the defining trait of **succulence**: having thick, fleshy parts that store water. This adaptation allows them to survive in arid climates or soil conditions where water is scarce, such as deserts and high-altitude areas.
    </p>

    <p>
        To minimize water loss, many succulents possess a waxy cuticle and have fewer stomata, often opening them only at night (CAM photosynthesis). Their shapes, such as spheres or compact rosettes, also help to reduce surface area exposed to the sun. This group is widely popular in landscaping and indoor gardening due to its resilience and unique appearance.
